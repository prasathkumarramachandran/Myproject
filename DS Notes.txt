Hyperparameter : what is making difference instance of the same algorigth behave differentyl ?

Variation at model level is different from variation of at Algorigthm level...

K nearest neibhour regression : 1 neighbour or 2 neighbour.... Algoright is varying due to external variant..

Hyperparameter tuning : Set of algorightms of trying out...

For Classification and Accuracy..
For Classification and Mean square..


K Means clustering.... Algorighth.. what is k ? K = Number of clustering...

Each cluster would have center point - called as centroild..
Every centroild is nearest to the cluster....

Start with random 3 centroids.. For all the points.. Which is nearest centroid..and make it clusters...
Now.. Once the random cluster is ready.. Find the centroid of the of the cluster..
and go through these multiple iterations until no points are moved to each other...

K Means ++ initilization to be done...
